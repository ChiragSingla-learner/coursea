I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you’ve cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the ‘examples/Lecture25’ folder. Copy the contents of ‘examples/Lecture25’ to your solution container folder (e.g., ‘module3-solution’) as a starting point..


Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., ‘md’, ‘sm’, and ‘xs’.
Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘md’-based classes
Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘sm’-based classes
Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘xs’-based classes


Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page, i.e., the default one that does not stay in the same place when the page scrolls. The navbar should have a company name (i.e., ‘navbar-brand’ class) called “Food, LLC” that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar. Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)

For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible. (Hint: use ‘visible-xs’ class on the button that activates the dropdown.)


Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make sure the dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.
